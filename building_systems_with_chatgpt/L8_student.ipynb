    "# Evaluation part I\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have developed a model, how do we know how it is actually doing? How do we measure its performance? In this section we will cover some best practices on how to evaluate LLMs. Unlike more traditional Machine Learning, the evaluation of LLMs does not start off with the test set. Instead, you start gradually building a collection of test examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "In traditional supervised learning, where the iteration from  labeled data to deployment can take many months, collecting a few more test samples is usually not a big deal. In LLM models, however, where one can specify a prompt in minutes and have something working in hours, it seems wasteful to wait to get more data. When developing an LLM, this is what usually happens:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You tune your prompts on a handful of examples (1-5).\n",
    "2. As the system undergoes additional testing, you add a few additional \"tricky\" examples in an opportunistic manner.\n",
    "3. Eventually you have enough of these examples that it becomes inconvenient to manually run the prompt on each of these examples, and you start developing metrics to measure performance on this small set of examples, like average accuracy.\n",
    "4. If you decide that your system is working well enough, you can stop right there.\n",
    "5. bIf your hand-built development set isn't giving you enough confidence in the performance of the system, you may collect a randomly sampled set of examples to tune to (development set/hold-out cross validation set).\n",
    "6. Only if you need even greater confidence, you would then collect and use a hold-out test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "The last points make more sense if your model is supposed to reach a large audience, and you want to make sure that no sensitive content is provided to the users.\n",
    "For completeness: Andrew Ng presented the above as 5 steps, namely:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Tune prompts on handful of examples.\n",
    "2. Add additional \"tricky\" examples opportunistically.\n",
    "3. Develop metrics to measure performance on examples.\n",
    "4. Collect randomly sampled set of examples to tune to (development set/hold-out cross validation set).\n",
    "5. Collect and use a hold-out test set.\n",
