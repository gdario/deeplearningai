    "LLMs are based on supervised learning, so the typical workflow is\n",
    "Get labeled data -> train model on data -> deploy and call model.\n",
    "An LLM is trained by repeatedly predicting the next word. Today there are two main types of LLMs: Base LLMs and Instruction Tuned LLMs. Base LLMs predict the next word based on the training data. However consider the question\n",
    "\n",
    "> what is the capital of France?\n",
    "\n",
    "it might be that the training set contains other questions (say from a quiz set), and would complete with `What is France largest city?` and so on, which is not what we want. To go from a Base LLM to an Instruction Tuned LLM you follow this process:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You train a Base LLM on a lot of data. This process can take months even on a large supercomputer.\n",
    "2. Fine-tune the model on examples where the output follows an input instruction. This is the case where many people write instruction-answer pairs and create a new training (fine-tuning) set.\n",
    "3. Obtain human ratings of the quality of different LLM outputs on criteria such as whether it is helpful, honest, and harmless.\n",
    "4. Further tune the LLM to increase the probability of generating the more highly rated outputs. Typically this is done via Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF).\n",
    "\n",
    "The process of training a Base LLM can take months on large supercomputers. The process of going from a Base LLM to an INstruction Tuned LLM can take days on much smaller hardware and dataset."
